# 1. The computer will "think" of a 3 digit number that has no repeating digits
# 2. You will guess a 3 digit number
# 3. The computer will then give back clues, possible clues are:

# - Close: You have guessed the correct number but in the wrong position.
# - Match: You have guessed the correct number in the correct position.
# - Nope: You haven't guessed any of the numbers correctly.

# Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a perfect match.
